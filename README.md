## Description
This project was made in order to apply and remember (with no frameworks) basic concepts of HTML, CSS and DOM manipulation with raw JavaScript.

I just tried to keep it clean and simple, I don't know if the background animation was too much, but I wanted to try anyway

## External Applications:

- All images are from  www.svgrepo.com.
 - With the exception of the profile picture that was made by me, and the background that was taken from a random place.
 
- To test if the responsiveness was actually working, i npm downloaded the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/simplehttpserver">simplehttpserver<a> to access the webpage on mobile.

- The background animation was made with <a href="https://www.vantajs.com">vanta.js.</a>
